Blacksite is an **experimental C++ game engine** built around [Jolt Physics](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics) from the ground up. This is a learning/research project exploring what happens when physics isn't an afterthought - everything is dynamic by default, and static objects require explicit opt-out.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Early Development**: This engine is in active development and **not suitable for production use**. It's great for learning, experimentation, and prototyping simple physics scenarios.

## üéØ Core Philosophy

**Physics-First Design**: Every object spawns with physics by default. Static objects require explicit opt-out.
```cpp
auto cube = engine.SpawnCube({0, 5, 0});     // Falls and bounces
auto ground = engine.SpawnPlane().MakeStatic(); // Must explicitly disable physics
```

**Fluent API**: Chain operations naturally without component hell.
```cpp
engine.SpawnSphere({-3, 8, 0})
    .Color(1.0f, 0.3f, 0.3f)
    .Scale(1.5f)
    .Push({5, 0, 0});  // Spawns, colors, scales, and applies force in one line
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **CMake 3.16+**
- **C++17 compatible compiler** (GCC 8+, Clang 7+, MSVC 2019+)
- **OpenGL 3.3+** compatible graphics drivers

### 1. Clone and Build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MintBlaster/Blacksite.git
cd blacksite
./scripts/setup.sh  # One-time setup (installs dependencies, builds submodules)
./scripts/dev.sh quick  # Build and run editor
```

### 2. Your First Physics Scene
```cpp
#include "blacksite/Blacksite.h"

int main() {
    Blacksite::Engine engine;

    if (!engine.Initialize(1920, 1080, "Physics Demo")) {
        return -1;
    }

    // Ground (static)
    auto ground = engine.SpawnPlane({0, -1, 0}, {20, 0.2f, 20});
    engine.GetEntity(ground).Color(0.3f, 0.3f, 0.3f).MakeStatic();

    // Falling objects (dynamic by default)
    auto redCube = engine.SpawnCube({-3, 5, 0});
    engine.GetEntity(redCube).Color(1.0f, 0.3f, 0.3f);

    auto greenSphere = engine.SpawnSphere({0, 8, 0});
    engine.GetEntity(greenSphere).Color(0.3f, 1.0f, 0.3f);

    // Camera setup
    engine.SetCameraPosition({10, 6, 10});
    engine.SetCameraTarget({0, 2, 0});

    return engine.Run();  // Launches editor with your scene
}
```

That's it! You now have a physics simulation with falling objects and a full editor interface.

## üì¶ Current Status

### ‚úÖ **Working Features**
- **Engine Core** - Initialize, run main loop, shutdown
- **Physics Integration** - Jolt Physics working, objects fall and bounce naturally
- **Entity System** - Simple entity spawning with fluent API
- **Basic Rendering** - Colored primitives (cubes, spheres, planes)
- **Editor Interface** - ImGui-based editor with scene hierarchy and inspector
- **Build System** - Comprehensive script-based development workflow

### üöß **Major Limitations**
- **No Input System** - Camera is code-only, no keyboard/mouse controls
- **No Asset Pipeline** - Primitives only, no mesh/texture loading
- **Basic Rendering** - No materials, lighting, or visual polish
- **No Audio** - No sound system at all
- **Limited Physics** - Basic shapes only, no joints or complex constraints

### üéØ **Good For**
- **Learning** - Understanding engine architecture and physics integration
- **Experimenting** - Testing the physics-first design approach
- **Simple Prototypes** - Basic physics scenarios with colored shapes

### ‚ùå **Not Good For**
- **Real Games** - Missing too many essential features
- **Performance Testing** - Not optimized
- **Production Use** - This is a learning/research project

## üéØ The Physics-First Experiment

This project explores: **What if physics wasn't an afterthought?**

### Traditional Approach
```cpp
// Easy to forget physics
GameObject obj = scene.CreateGameObject();
obj.AddComponent<MeshRenderer>();
// obj.AddComponent<RigidBody>();  // Oops! Object won't fall
```

### Our Approach
```cpp
// Physics by default - explicit opt-out required
auto obj = engine.SpawnCube({0, 5, 0});  // Falls immediately
// To make it static: obj.MakeStatic();
```

**This is research** - exploring ideas, not claiming superiority over existing engines.
