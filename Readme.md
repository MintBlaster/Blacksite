# Blacksite Engine

Blacksite is a modular, physics-first C++ game engine built for real-time destruction, vehicles, and dynamic, interactive worlds. Powered by Jolt Physics, it flips the usual game engine flow: physics is the foundation, not an optional plugin.

## Highlights
* **Physics-First Architecture** - Every object is dynamic by default. Rigidbodies, collisions, and forces aren't bolted on ‚Äî they are the system. Powered by Jolt Physics.
* **Modular Core** - Clean separation between engine subsystems: windowing, physics, rendering, input, asset loading ‚Äî you plug in what you need.
* **Modern Rendering Stack** - OpenGL (for now) with GLM math, shader support, and a clean pipeline coming next.
* **Cross-Platform** - Actively tested on Linux. Windows/macOS coming soon. No engine-specific IDE lock-in.
* **Clean AF API** - Declarative API. Spawn objects with physics in one line. No setup, Just behavior.

## Physics-First API Design

```cpp
#include <blacksite.h>

int main() {
    Blacksite::Engine engine;
    engine.Init();
    
    auto scene = engine.CreateScene();
    
    // Everything is a physical object by default
    auto cube = scene.Spawn("cube.obj")  // Loads mesh + creates physics body
        .At({0, 5, 0})
        .WithMass(2.5f)
        .Push({0, 0, 10});  // Instantly has physics
    
    // Static objects opt-out of dynamics
    auto ground = scene.Spawn()
        .AsPlane()
        .Material(Material::ASPHALT)
        .MakeStatic();  // Only way to disable physics
    
    // UI elements live in screen space, not physics space
    auto hud = scene.UI()
        .Text("Score: 0")
        .At({10, 10});
    
    return engine.Run(); // Starts fixed-step simulation + rendering loop
}
```

## Current Status

- **Fluid Simulation** - Water, particles
- **Advanced Rendering** - PBR, shadows, post-processing

## Why Physics-First?

Because most engines treat physics like some shitty afterthought. Blacksite flips that:
* Objects behave like real objects by default.
* Destruction isn't faked ‚Äî it's simulated.
* No extra work to "enable" physics ‚Äî it's already on.
* Ideal for making chaotic, dynamic, or vehicular-heavy games.

If you're tired of manually toggling Rigidbody checkboxes or writing boilerplate to add collision logic, this engine is for you.

## Contributing

+ Want to help shape a true physics-core engine from scratch? Good.

+ Pull requests welcome ‚Äî but bring ideas, not just code.

- Physics abstraction layer (Jolt wrappers, body/component sync)
- OpenGL rendering pipeline + ECS-friendly material/shader system
- Scene graph with component system (basic ECS already bootstrapped)
- Asset loading (mesh, textures, prefabs)
- Input system (GLFW or platform-agnostic)

Open an issue or pull request if you're serious.
